# BADUSB Script for Kiosk Breakouts

General script is in `breakout_payload.txt`, but you can modify the generation if you'd like in `gen_script.py`

Note that as this is a general script, there are some modifiers which will simply mean nothing to some systems. For example, the Globe to a non-mac system, or the SysRQ to a non-linux system.
